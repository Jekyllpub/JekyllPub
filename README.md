# Jekyll Pub

By [Sebastian Lopez](http://github.com/sebastian9] and [ZtuX](http://github.com/ztux)

Jekyll is a static site generator built with Ruby that uses Shopify's Liquid as a templating language. It is simple, meaning it's got no databases or complicated configurations; static, since it generates HTML/CSS and Javascript files ready to deploy; and blog aware, thanks to its many built-in functionalities.

Static Site generators are the next generation of blogging engines since they are simple, scalable and pretty fast; static file serving is cheap, and there's no need for server side operations when all you need is a blog with a couple hundred posts and with all this [tools available today for static sites](http://cloudcannon.com/tips/2014/12/12/the-ultimate-list-of-services-for-static-websites.html). 

Jekyll has been called "The Blogging Plataform for Geeks" which is nice, but it's precisley its main problem as I see it. I have a project called Dodecaedro hosted in [Github Pages](http://dodecaedro.mx) as a starting point, but one of the main reasons the project has now been stopped is that I had to update and format every post that was ever written. A task that consumed valuable time that could be spent getting interviews or gathering more writers (which eventually I wouldn't manage to upload).

As they say at Cloud Cannon:

"The main reasons we hear for not using static websites are: Non-technical users can’t update static websites easily."

So this is what Jekyll Pub means to give a solution for. Jekyll Pub is a rails app (currently in construction) you can upload to heroku for writers to manage site's posts (in a RESTful way). This will enable us Geeks to have a proper site hosted in Github Pages that can be updated by non-tech people, at the begginig this app way require some Ruby on Rails basics in order to be tweaked depending on your site need but this aims to be a full solution even for no rubyists.
